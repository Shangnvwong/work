# Hello! 

#  I have a static blog built with Next.js! But it's not finished yet, it's in a half-finished state! I don't know how far the original developer took it to make it!

## So now I need you to help me solve  problems!

1.Integrate **mdx-bundler** for this blog in order to make it a static blog that can update posts with **markdown**!

I'll provide you with a copy of the site source code for your modifications, and you can download it from [here](This document is no longer available, please contact me)!

Apparently the original developer didn't integrate for it the ability to convert markdown files into static pages causing it to not work as a static blog and I can't update the site!
So I need you to integrate **mdx-bundler** for it, using [this](https://github.com/kentcdodds/mdx-bundler#installation) tool

That way I can use markdown to write articles and put them under the website folder (you need to tell me which folder to put them under) to compile them into static pages!

It should work like a static blog generator like [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)!

2.You will also need to create 3 pages of documentation for me to configure information and changes to:

1. index * This is the content page for the home page of the site to be displayed.

  2.about * This is the page with the introduction and description of the site.

 3.speech*This page does not know what to do for now

writings * All my blog posts should be updated here, where people can see what I've posted!

Please make sure you understand and appreciate my needs!
I don't want you to go in the wrong direction!

Please do not change the arrangement of the navigation bar and the background of the home page of the website
